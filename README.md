# Description
This project is developed to analyze Medicare hospital spending by Claim and create an interactive dashboard.

It focuses on analyzing and comparing the average spending levels, in 2015 and 2022 during hospitals' Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes by Medicare claim type.

Note: An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to an inpatient hospital admission through 30 days after discharge.

The project delves into integrating claims data over 2 years (2015 and 2022) and generating valuable insights conveyed through an interactive dashboard.
